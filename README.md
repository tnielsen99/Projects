## About Me

Hello! 

My name is Timo and welcome to my Project Portfolio! A little bit about me:

I am currently a Data Scientist/Control Systems Engineer at McLaren Automotive in the powertrain testing department. 

I am result driven resilient self-starter, who is commercially focused and target driven, with a proven track record for delivering projects on time, with passion for interrogating problems through statistical visualisations by building Jupyter notebooks or Tableau Dashboards to guide the reader to the solution.

Specialities include: 
 - Python 
 - Machine Learning
    - Linear Regression
    - K-Means Clustering 
    - SVM
    - Neural Nets (Currently Learning)
    - NLP (Currently Learning)
 - Amazon Web Services (S3, EC2, Aurora, Lambda & Redshift) 
 - SQL 
 - Hadoop 
 - Spark 
 - MATLAB

I have a positive “can do” approach, with excellent communication and interpersonal skills. I am numeric, data analytical and have strong problem-solving capabilities. My goal is ultimately to become a successful leader in applying data analysis to deliver solutions for complex industrial problems.

Outside of work, I enjoy photography and cinematography to stimulate my creative side. Been traveling the world taking photos for over 10 years now, still one of my biggest passions to express thoughts through photography.

Now I focus on programming for whatever problems come my way, automating my life wherever I can and conducting analysis on topics that interest me!
